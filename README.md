# Videos_in_a_Playlist
# ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Playlist Scraper (Selenium + BeautifulSoup)

This Python script extracts video links from a YouTube playlist by scraping `<a id="thumbnail">` elements using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

YouTube dynamically renders content using JavaScript, so traditional HTTP-based scraping (like with `requests`) will not work. Selenium opens a real browser, waits for the page to load, and then extracts the video links.
